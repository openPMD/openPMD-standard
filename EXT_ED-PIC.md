Domain-Specific Naming Conventions for Electro-Dynamic/Static PIC Codes
=======================================================================

openPMD extension name: `ED-PIC`


Introduction
------------

This extension is specifically designed for the domain of electro-dynamic and
electro-static particle-in-cell (PIC) codes.

The current version of this extension is suitable to allow the output of
arbitrary simulation codes to be post-processed and compared with common
tools and frameworks. Future versions will define a common set of required
records and further attributes (e.g., for moving window and boosted frame
simulations) that will allow to restart the checkpoints of one PIC code with
an other.


Dependencies
------------

This extension depends on the [ParticleWeighting](EXT_ParticleWeighting.md) extension.

It is sufficient for writers to only declare the `ED-PIC` extension to express this dependency. Thus, reading implementations need to be aware that a declared `ED-PIC` extension implies `ParticleWeighting` is also applied.

    - description: additional parameters to describe the applied filter
                   further (similar to `currentSmoothingParameters`)

### Naming Conventions for `mesh record`s (field records)

When added to an output, the following naming conventions shall be used for
`mesh records` to allow an easy the identification of essential fields. If
these namings are not used, tools might still detect a record by it's
`unitDimension` as, e.g., *an* electric field but not as *the* main electric
field that should be distributed again on the cells.

- fundamental fields:
  - `E`
    - type: *(floatX)* or *(intX)* or *(uintX)*
    - description: the electric field
    - advice to implementors: a *(floatX)* type is likely the most frequent case
                              for this record
    - advice to implementors: must have
                              `unitDimension = (1., 1., -3., -1., 0., 0., 0.)`
                              (V/m = kg * m / (A * s^3))
  - `B`
    - type: *(floatX)* or *(intX)* or *(uintX)*
    - description: the magnetic field
    - advice to implementors: must have
                              `unitDimension = (0., 1., -2., -1., 0., 0., 0.)`
                              (T = kg / (A * s^2))
    - advice to implementors: a *(floatX)* type is likely the most frequent case
                              for this record

- auxiliary fields:
  - fields derived from particle species, discretized on the mesh (cells):
    prefix them with `<particleSpecies>_*`:
    - defined names and examples:
      - `J`: such as `electron_J` for current densities created by the
             particles in particle species `electron`
      - `density`: such as `electron_density` (elements per volume/area/line)
      - `chargeDensity`: such as `electron_chargeDensity` (charge per
                         volume/area/line)
      - `particleEnergy`: kinetic energy of all particles, with their weighted
                          contribution to a cell
      - `energyDensity`: same as `particleEnergy` but divided by `density`
      - `particleCounter`: ignores the shape of a particle and just checks if
                           the position of it "corresponds" to a cell

  - to store the same quantities as above, but summed for each cell over all
    particles in all particle species, skip the prefix and use the defined
    names directly

                   section 2.4
    - allowed values:
      - `uniform`: The fields are interpolated directly from the staggered grid

### Additional Attributes for each Particle `Record`

Note the definitions of the attributes `macroWeighted` and `weightingPower` in the [ParticleWeighting](EXT_ParticleWeighting.md) extension.

### Namings for `Records` per Particle Species

When added as records to a particle output, the following naming conventions
shall be used to allow an easy identification of essential particle
properties. If these namings are not used, tools might still detect a particles
property by it's `unitDimension` as, e.g., *an* arbitrary momentum (could be,
e.g., an additional record defined by the user that stores the integrated
momentum change due to collisions) but not as *the* particle momentum that
should be used to push the particle.

  - `charge`
    - type: *(floatX)* or *(intX)* or *(uintX)*
    - description: electric charge of the macroparticle or of the underlying
                   individual particle (depending on the `macroWeighted` flag)
    - advice to implementors: must have `weightingPower = 1` and
                              `unitDimension = (0., 0., 1., 1., 0., 0., 0.)`
                              (charge = current * time)

  - `mass`
    - type: *(floatX)* or *(intX)* or *(uintX)*
    - description: mass of the macroparticle or of the underlying individual
                   particle (depending on the `macroWeighted` flag)
    - advice to implementors: must have `weightingPower = 1` and
                              `unitDimension = (0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.)`
                              (mass)

  - `weighting`
    - see the [ParticleWeighting](EXT_ParticleWeighting.md) extension

  - `momentum/` + components such as `x`, `y` and `z`
    - type: each component in *(floatX)* or *(intX)* or *(uintX)*
    - description: component-wise momentum of the macroparticle or of the
                   underlying individual particle (depending on the
                   `macroWeighted` flag)
    - advice to implementors: must have `weightingPower = 1` and
                              `unitDimension = (1., 1., -1., 0., 0., 0., 0.)`
                              (momentum = mass * length / time)

  - `position/` + components such as `x`, `y` and `z`
    - type: each component in *(floatX)* or *(intX)* or *(uintX)*
    - description: component-wise position of a particle, relative to
                   `positionOffset`
      - in the case where the `component`s of `positionOffset` are constant,
        position is the position relative to a global offset (e.g., the offset
        of a moving window)
      - in the case where the `component`s of `positionOffset` are
        non-constant, `position` must represent the in-cell-position and
        `positionOffset` must represent the position of the beginning of the
        cell (see below)
    - rationale: dividing the particle position in a beginning of the cell
                 (as *(intX)*) and in-cell position (as *(floatX)*) can
                 dramatically improve the precision of stored particle
                 positions; this division creates a connection between
                 particles and the fields on their cells
    - advice to implementors: must have `weightingPower = 0` and
                              `unitDimension = (1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.)`
                              (length)
    - advice to implementors: a *(floatX)* type is likely the most frequent case
                              for this record
    - example: use only `x` and `y` in 2D

  - `positionOffset/` + components such as `x`, `y` and `z`
    - type: each component in *(floatX)* or *(intX)* or *(uintX)*
    - description: if the `component`s of this record are non-constant
                   this must represent the position of the beginning of the
                   cell the particle is associated with;
                   for the zero-based index `i` of the first cartesian field
                   coordinate, the position of the beginning of the cell is
                   defined via `gridGlobalOffset + i * gridSpacing`;
                   the `unitSI` of each component must be set to the
                   corresponding lengths of the cell's edges in SI units
    - advice to implementors: the interpretation of `position` and
                              `positionOffset` does not alter the pure
                              calculation of the global position of the
                              particle from the base standard; see the base
                              standard for a code example
    - advice to implementors: must have `weightingPower = 0` and
                              `unitDimension = (1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.)`
                              (length)
    - advice to implementors: an *(intX)* or *(uintX)* type is likely the most
                              frequent case for this record
    - advice to implementors: if you want to neglect the relation between
                              particles and their cells, simply store this
                              record with constant components, e.g., the
                              global moving window offset

  - `particlePatches`
    - description: if this sub-group is used in combination with non-constant
                   components in the `positionOffset` components, the
                   position for `offset` and `extent` refers to the
                   position of the beginning of the cell (see `positionOffset`)
    - advice to implementors: the calculation and description of
                              `position` and `positionOffset` is as in
                              the base standard still the same;
                              for non-constant components in `positionOffset`
                              (beginning-of-cell representation) one can simply
                              check `offset` and `extent` against the
                              `positionOffset` record to select particles
                              in patches "by cell"

  - `boundElectrons`
    - type: *(floatX)* or *(intX)* or *(uintX)*
    - description: number of bound electrons of an ion/atom;
                   to provide information to atomic physics algorithms
    - advice to implementors: must have `weightingPower = 1` and
                              `unitDimension = (0., ..., 0.)` (dimensionless)
